# Diopser

You were expecting Disperser[ยน](#disperser), but it was me, Diopser!

Diopser lets you rotate the phase of a signal around a specific frequency
without affecting its spectral content. This effect can be used to emphasize
transients and other parts of a sound that in a way that isn't possible with
regular equalizers or dynamics processors, especially when applied to low
pitched or wide band sounds. More extreme settings will make everything sound
like a cartoon laser beam, or a psytrance kickdrum. If you are experimenting
with those kinds of settings, then you may want to consider temporarily placing
a peak limiter after the plugin in case loud resonances start building up.

This is a port from https://github.com/robbert-vdh/diopser with more features
and much better performance.
